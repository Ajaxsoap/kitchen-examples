Invoices example
================

This simple invoicing application shows how to work with DataViews, Forms with dates and lookup fields, master-detail relations etc.

**JSON** and **YAML** files are the same example in different formats.

To run example, inside this directory type:

```
meteor-kitchen ./example-invoices.json ./example-invoices
cd ./example-invoices
meteor
```

To use the **YAML** example you'll need to have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2yaml" target="_blank">json2yaml</a> converter installed.

You can see live example <a href="http://generator-invoices.meteor.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
