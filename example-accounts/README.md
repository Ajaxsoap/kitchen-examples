User accounts example
=====================

This example will build minimal meteor application with user account system.

**JSON** and **YAML** files are the same example in different formats.


To run example, inside this directory type:

```
meteor-kitchen ./example-accounts.json ./example-accounts
cd ./example-accounts
meteor
```

To use the **YAML** example you'll need to have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2yaml" target="_blank">json2yaml</a> converter installed.
